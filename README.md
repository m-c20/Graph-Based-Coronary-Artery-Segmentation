This repository provides a Python implementation of the VesselWalker algorithm for coronary artery segmentation in 2D X-ray angiograms. The approach revisits a traditional graph-based vessel tracking method, emphasizing computational efficiency and interpretability in contrast to deep learning–based segmentation techniques.

The pipeline includes image preprocessing for contrast normalization and noise reduction, followed by vessel segmentation and quantitative evaluation against ground-truth annotations. Performance is assessed using Dice score, sensitivity, and specificity, and results are compared with the original MATLAB implementation for validation.
